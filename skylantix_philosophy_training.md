## Core Identity

### What Skylantix Is

**Skylantix is a collective microcloud**—not a corporation, not a startup, not a traditional business. It is:

- A community of users and technologists who believe digital life should be personal, private, and ethical
- A sustainable, human-scale cloud hosting model that values fairness, transparency, and generosity over growth for its own sake
- A digital village where users know their sysadmin by name
- A reclamation of the decentralized, personal, curious internet that was meant to be

### The Mission Statement

To create sustainable, human-scale cloud infrastructure that serves people—not the other way around. Technology should work for humans, not extract from them.

### The Tagline

**"A cloud that doesn't pretend to own the sky."**

---

## Founding Principles

### 1. Technology Should Serve People

Technology is not an end in itself. It's a tool that should enhance human dignity, privacy, and autonomy. Skylantix rejects the notion that people should adapt to serve technology platforms.

### 2. The Internet Was Meant to Be Decentralized

The original vision of the internet was decentralized, personal, and curious. Skylantix reclaims that spirit by building infrastructure that doesn't depend on hyperscalers (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).

### 3. Growth for Its Own Sake is Harmful

Exponential growth destroys community, erodes quality, and forces extraction. Skylantix chooses deliberate, sustainable growth over venture-backed scaling.

### 4. Transparency Builds Trust

You don't expect trust without proof. Skylantix operates in the open with published financials, honest communication, and community governance.

### 5. Community Over Customers

Members aren't customers or users—they're part of a collective. They participate in governance, vote on priorities, and share in the collective's success.

### 6. Fairness Over Profit Maximization

Pricing reflects actual costs, not what the market will bear. Profit sharing ensures success benefits everyone, not just founders.

---

## The Six Promises

These are Skylantix's commitments to every member:

### 1. Fair Pricing, Real Costs

What you pay reflects the actual cost of running and improving the service—no hidden fees, no artificial scarcity. Prices adjust only if the real world demands it: hardware, electricity, or bandwidth, not corporate greed.

**Key Principles:**
- Pricing transparency
- No surprise increases
- Grandfathered pricing for existing members (1 year minimum)
- 90 days notice before any price changes

### 2. Shared Prosperity

If Skylantix has a good year, members feel it too. Some years that means better hardware, more features, or free upgrades. Some years, it means no bill in December. When Skylantix wins, everyone wins.

**Key Principles:**
- Surplus profits split 50/50: reinvestment and community donations
- Members vote on allocation priorities
- Early member rewards at viability milestones
- Community grants and zero-interest loans

### 3. Sustainable Independence

Skylantix owns its hardware, pays its own bills, and answers to no investors. That keeps the collective honest and lets it stay small enough to care.

**Key Principles:**
- Owner-managed hardware (no hyperscaler lock-in)
- No venture capital or investor pressure
- Infrastructure costs covered at just 10 members
- Hardware amortized over 3-5 years

### 4. Privacy by Design

Member data lives on physical servers in California—encrypted at rest and in transit. It's never tracked, mined, or sold.

**Key Principles:**
- California-based data sovereignty
- End-to-end encryption for Nextcloud
- LUKS encrypted drives
- No data mining, selling, or AI training on member data
- No surveillance capitalism

### 5. Stewardship Over Growth

Skylantix isn't trying to host the world, just the right kind of people. When the collective reaches its ideal size (5,000 members), it will slow down, switch to invites, and focus on making what exists better instead of bigger.

**Key Principles:**
- Intentional growth cap at 5,000 members globally
- Quality over quantity
- Deliberate expansion (not exponential)
- Success measured in trust, not market share

### 6. Radical Transparency

Skylantix runs in the open—with status pages, changelogs, and yearly transparency reports that show where money goes, how systems perform, and what the collective is improving. Honesty isn't a feature here; it's infrastructure.

**Key Principles:**
- Published annual financial reports
- Open communication channels (Mattermost)
- Honest incident reporting and learning in public
- Community accountability

## Pricing Philosophy

### The $20 Price Point

Each Skylantix membership costs **$20 per month** or **$200 per year**. That price is deliberate:

1. **Affordable but Substantial**: Enough to sustain the service without exploiting users
2. **Psychologically Sincere**: Not rounded to $19.99 or $14.99, but chosen with intention
3. **Room for Discounts**: Leaves space for 40% student discounts without collapsing margins
4. **Fair Value**: The price of a cup of coffee per week for privacy, reliability, and transparency

### No Tiered Pricing

Everyone pays the same price and gets the same services. No upsells, no premium tiers, no artificial feature gates. This reinforces the collective model: all members are equal.

### Student Discount Rationale

Students (40% off + 1 month free = $12/month) represent the collective's investment in the next generation of privacy-conscious technologists. The discount is generous because education and access matter.

### Early Member Rewards

The first 50 members receive extraordinary rewards when Skylantix reaches 1,250 members:
- **Annual subscribers**: Free for life
- **Monthly subscribers**: Permanent 50% discount ($10/month)

This honors those who trusted the collective early and helped build it from the ground up.

---

## Community Vision

### The Digital Village Concept

Skylantix aims to feel less like a service provider and more like a **digital village**. This means:

- Users know their sysadmin by name
- Support happens via Mattermost (community chat), not ticket systems
- Members participate in governance through voting and discussion
- The collective grows through word-of-mouth and trust, not marketing campaigns
- Success is measured in relationships, not revenue

### Community Governance

Members actively shape the collective through:

1. **Charity Allocation Voting**: Deciding which organizations receive donations from profit-sharing pool
2. **Feature Priority Polls**: Determining which new services get developed first
3. **Infrastructure Decisions**: Weighing in on hardware upgrades, new locations, and technical priorities
4. **Policy Feedback**: Direct input on pricing adjustments, terms, and collective evolution

### Community Scale

5,000 members is not arbitrary:
- Small enough to maintain personal relationships
- Large enough to be financially sustainable
- Sized to allow ~1,250 members per geographic location (4 locations in Southern California)
- Manageable for human-scale operations without corporate bureaucracy

---

## Human-Scale Philosophy

### Why Limits Matter

Skylantix intentionally caps growth at 5,000 members because:

1. **Quality over Quantity**: Personal service requires limits
2. **Maintainable Relationships**: You can't know 100,000 people by name
3. **No Investor Pressure**: Small scale means no pressure for exponential growth
4. **Sustainable Operations**: Human-scale infrastructure is more resilient
5. **Community Cohesion**: Smaller communities build stronger trust

### Growth Timeline

Growth is **deliberate**, not exponential:

- **Phase 1 (Pre-graduation)**: 0-10 members (infrastructure sustainability)
- **Phase 2 (Year 1)**: 10-100 members (operational viability)
- **Phase 3 (Years 2-3)**: 100-1,250 members (financial viability, admin wages)
- **Phase 4 (Years 4+)**: 1,250-5,000 members (steady state, community focus)

### Measuring Success

Most companies measure success in:
- User growth
- Revenue
- Market share
- Valuation

Skylantix measures success in:
- **Uptime**: Service reliability and infrastructure stability
- **Trust**: Member satisfaction and retention
- **Community Health**: Active participation in governance
- **Sustainability**: Stable operations without extraction
- **Impact**: Contributions to open-source community

## Privacy & Dignity

### Privacy as a Human Right

Privacy isn't a premium feature—it's a fundamental human right. Skylantix treats privacy as:

- **Non-negotiable**: Built into architecture, not bolted on
- **Transparent**: Members know exactly how data is handled
- **Community-governed**: Privacy policies voted on by members
- **Legally clear**: U.S. law applies, California data sovereignty

### No Surveillance Capitalism

Skylantix explicitly rejects:

- Data mining and analysis of member content
- Selling or sharing member information with third parties
- Training AI models on member data
- Advertising or tracking pixels
- Analytics beyond basic server monitoring

### Data Sovereignty

Members know exactly where their data lives:
- **Geographic Location**: Irvine, Long Beach, Santa Clarita (California)
- **Physical Hardware**: Owner-managed servers (not hyperscalers)
- **Legal Jurisdiction**: U.S. law, California-based
- **Access Control**: Only infrastructure admins, only when necessary for support

### Dignity Over Domination

The long-term goal is not domination—it's **dignity**:

- A place where users know their sysadmin by name
- A cloud that doesn't pretend to own the sky
- Proof that human-scale, transparent, community-driven infrastructure is viable
- A model for others to replicate (not franchise, but inspire)

---

## Transparency as Infrastructure

### Why "Radical Transparency"?

Transparency isn't a marketing term at Skylantix—it's fundamental infrastructure. The collective cannot function without trust, and trust requires proof.

### What Gets Transparently Shared

1. **Annual Financials**:
   - Total revenue from memberships
   - Infrastructure costs (hardware, bandwidth, power)
   - Operating expenses
   - Founder/admin wages
   - Charity donations breakdown
   - Reinvestment allocations

2. **Infrastructure Information**:
   - Server locations and specifications
   - Backup procedures and testing
   - Security architecture
   - Uptime statistics
   - Incident reports and postmortems

3. **Governance Decisions**:
   - Policy changes and reasoning
   - Community vote results
   - Feature development priorities
   - Future plans and timelines

### Learning in Public

Skylantix is openly positioned as a **learning project**:

- Founder is a student building production infrastructure
- Mistakes will happen and will be shared honestly
- Incident reports focus on learning and improvement
- Community members see the collective grow and evolve

This honesty sets realistic expectations and builds trust.

- Venture capital investment or acquisition
- Compromising transparency for profit
- Becoming "just another hosting company"
- Extracting maximum revenue from members
- Scaling beyond human-scale operations

---

## What Skylantix is NOT

To understand Skylantix's philosophy, it's important to understand what it explicitly rejects:

### Not a Startup

Skylantix is not chasing unicorn status, venture funding, or acquisition. It's a craft project with business upside—sustainable, deliberate, and values-driven.

### Not a Corporation

Skylantix operates initially as a sole proprietorship with the internal ethics of a collective. It may evolve into a nonprofit or collective legal structure, but it will never become a traditional corporation focused on shareholder value.

### Not Venture-Backed

No investors means no pressure for exponential growth, no pivot demands, no exit strategy requirements. Skylantix grows at the pace the community can sustain.

### Not Surveillance Capitalism

Member data is never mined, sold, tracked, or used for AI training. Skylantix makes money from membership fees, not from exploiting member information.

### Not Anonymous or Faceless

Members know their sysadmin by name. Communication is direct and personal. This isn't a faceless corporation—it's a community.

### Not Trying to Scale Indefinitely

5,000 members is the cap. Beyond that, the collective would lose its human-scale character and community cohesion.

### Not Hiding Behind Corporate Opacity

Everything operates in the open: financials, infrastructure decisions, governance, mistakes. Corporate secrecy erodes trust.

---

## Closing Philosophy

Skylantix's long-term goal is not domination—it's **dignity**.

The internet was meant to be:
- **Decentralized**: Not controlled by a handful of megacorporations
- **Personal**: Tools that serve individuals, not extract from them
- **Curious**: Open to experimentation and community-driven innovation

Skylantix simply reclaims that spirit.

**A place where users know their sysadmin by name.**

**A cloud that doesn't pretend to own the sky.**

# SKYLANTIX - Website Content Brief

## WHO WE ARE
Skylantix is a boutique managed hosting company based in Orange County, California. We provide personal, white-glove hosting services for people and small businesses who want privacy, reliability, and actual human support—without the corporate BS or inflated prices of big cloud providers.

## WHAT WE DO
We host and manage your applications so you don't have to deal with servers, updates, backups, or infrastructure headaches. This isn't raw VPS hosting where we hand you SSH access and say "good luck." We manage everything end-to-end.

**Services we offer:**
- Shared Nextcloud hosting (your private cloud storage)
- Managed Django/Python app hosting
- Custom containerized applications (Docker/Kubernetes)
- Any self-hosted software you want to run but don't want to manage

We front everything through Cloudflare for security, speed, and DDoS protection. Your data stays in California, not scattered across Amazon's datacenters.

## THE STORY/ABOUT
Started by a UChicago student who loves infrastructure and DevOps work. Tired of seeing people forced to choose between:
1. Expensive "managed" hosting that still requires technical knowledge
2. Big tech surveillance capitalism (Google, Microsoft, etc.)
3. DIY self-hosting that becomes a second job

Skylantix is the answer: professional managed hosting with actual personal service, privacy guarantees, and pricing that respects your budget. Based in Orange County, serving customers who want their data in California, not in a faceless datacenter farm.

## TONE/VOICE
- Professional but approachable
- Technical but not gatekeeping
- Confident without being arrogant
- Honest about what we are (boutique, small) and what we're not (enterprise-scale)
- A little personality—we're not a faceless corporation
- "No BS" energy without being unprofessional

## TECHNICAL DETAILS (for credibility)
- Infrastructure: High-performance servers with redundant internet (fiber + cable + 5G backup)
- Power: Solar + battery backup for reliability
- Orchestration: Docker/Kubernetes for container management
- Security: Cloudflare fronting all services for DDoS protection and SSL
- Backups: Automated offsite backups following 3-2-1 rule
- Monitoring: 24/7 automated monitoring with alerting
- Location: California-based infrastructure

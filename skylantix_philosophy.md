## The Skylantix Philosophy

### Founding Principles
Skylantix is not a corporation. It is a cooperative microcloud—a community of users and technologists who believe digital life should be personal, private, and ethical. The goal is simple: to create a sustainable, human-scale cloud hosting model that values fairness, transparency, and generosity over growth for its own sake.

### The Pricing Philosophy
Each Skylantix membership costs **$17 per month**. That price is deliberate:
- It’s affordable but substantial—enough to sustain the service without exploiting users.
- It’s psychologically sincere: not rounded to $19.99 or $14.99, but chosen with intention.
- It leaves room for student discounts (up to 40%) without collapsing margins.
- It reflects fairness: the value of a cup of coffee per week for privacy, reliability, and transparency.

### The Structure
Skylantix will operate initially as a **sole proprietorship (Schedule C)**, but with the internal ethics of a cooperative. As the project grows, it may evolve into a nonprofit or cooperative structure—but the core principles will remain unchanged:
- **Sustainability:** Hardware amortized every 3–5 years, fully owned, with RAID10 + Z2/3 backups and caching layers for efficiency (Raid Z2/Z3 to be implimented when fincances allow).

### The Growth Vision
The Skylantix user base will remain intentionally small—**no more than 5,000 members** globally. Each user receives:
- Secure, fast Nextcloud hosting with end-to-end encryption with 180 GB of storage.
- Additional offerings such as hosted Bitwarden, Firefly (for fincances), an @mail.skylantix.com email with 20GB of storage (so it's a drop in replacment for Google workspace), a Mattermost account, and Gitea for projects.
- We will also offer hosting for user's personal projects such as Django and whatnot at a later date.
- Personalized support via Mattermost or email (no ticket bureaucracy).


Growth will not be exponential; it will be *deliberate*. The project’s health is measured in **trust**, not market share.

### Caching & Infrastructure
With Cloudflare and VPS-based caching, Skylantix can reduce outbound bandwidth by 96–98%, keeping operational costs and ISP scrutiny minimal. Each location (e.g., Irvine, Long Beach, Santa Clarita) will host roughly 1,250 users—balancing load, redundancy, and data sovereignty.

Hardware and compute amortization will ensure stable costs while user data remains on owner-managed, privacy-respecting systems. No hyperscaler lock-in.



### User Ownership and Community
Early members are rewarded for their trust and contributions. Additional users who make major contributions (testing, documentation, referrals) may also receive lifetime access.

All users are invited to Mattermost to discuss updates, and provide direct feedback. Skylantix aims to feel less like a service provider and more like a *digital village*.

### Future Expansion
Over time, Skylantix may split into two branches:
1. **Skylantix Core (cooperative)** – The community-driven, capped user base described above.
2. **A sister brand (for-profit)** – Offering managed services, consulting, or white-glove hosting at the same ethical standards but under a separate identity.

This ensures the cooperative stays pure while still allowing the founder and team to experiment commercially.

### Closing Vision
Skylantix’s long-term goal is not domination—it’s dignity. The internet was meant to be decentralized, personal, and curious. Skylantix simply reclaims that spirit.

A place where users know their sysadmin by name.

A cloud that doesn’t pretend to own the sky.

# Site Consistency Status - Last Reviewed: 2025-11-01

## ✅ RESOLVED ISSUES

  1. ✅ Services list - Now consistent across all pages (Nextcloud, Email, Bitwarden, Linkding, Mattermost, Gitea, Immich, Minecraft Server)
  2. ✅ Storage allocation - Consistently "200 GB total (180 GB Nextcloud/Immich + 20 GB email)"
  3. ✅ Business identity - Consistently described as "collective microcloud"
  4. ✅ Dates updated - All dates now show 2025-11-01
  5. ✅ Firefly removed - No longer mentioned anywhere
  6. ✅ Profit distribution - Clearly stated as "50/50 split after admin wages" (50% reinvestment, 50% open-source)
  7. ✅ Student discount - Consistently "40% off + 1 month free for undergraduate students"
  8. ✅ Early member perks - Clearly defined (Annual = free for life, Monthly = 50% off at 1,200 members)
  9. ✅ RAID Z2/Z3 - Consistently "RAID10 now, RAID Z2/Z3 backup added at 100 members"

## ⚠️ REMAINING MINOR ISSUES

  1. **Duplicate content** - skylantix_philosophy.md in root folder contains old/merged content (consider deleting)
  2. **Voice consistency** - Mixed use of "I" (founder voice) vs "we" (collective voice)
     - Recommendation: Hybrid approach (use "I" for personal/founder content, "we" for collective/infrastructure)
  3. **Location descriptions** - Minor variations (some say "California-based", others specify "Irvine → Long Beach → Santa Clarita")
     - Recommendation: Keep specific roadmap version for transparency
  4. **Untracked file** - src/layouts/_default/feature.html shows as untracked in git
  5. **Chinese placeholder content** - zh-cn/ directory (if internationalization not planned, consider removing)

## 📊 OVERALL STATUS

**Site consistency: EXCELLENT** 🎉

Core messaging is aligned across all pages. The remaining issues are minor style/cleanup items that don't affect user experience or messaging clarity.

# Current Conflicts
##  Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

  1. Services list conflicts - Different pages list different services. Some pages include Immich/Minecraft Server, others list Firefly, and some have neither.
  2. Storage allocation confusion - Multiple interpretations of the 200GB storage (180GB Nextcloud/Immich + 20GB email vs just "180GB")
  3. Business identity crisis - Site can't decide if you're a "collective microcloud" or a "hosting company"
  4. Outdated copyright year - license.md shows 2024, but system date is 2025-10-31
  5. Privacy policy date issue - Shows "Last Updated: October 24, 2025" which seems incorrectly set
  6. Placeholder Chinese files - zh-cn/ directory has untranslated placeholder content

##  High Priority Issues

  7. Profit distribution unclear - transparency.md mentions "50% of profits beyond a modest cap" but doesn't explain what happens to the other 50% or define the cap
  8. Student discount tiers - Most pages say "up to 40%" but only membership.md explains the tiered structure (40% for UChicago/UCI, 20% for others)
  9. Early member perks too vague - Mentioned everywhere but never specifically defined
  10. Location descriptions vary - "California-based" vs "Orange County, California" vs "Irvine, Long Beach, Santa Clarita"
  11. Infrastructure status confusion - Some docs say RAID Z2/Z3 exists, others say it's "planned when finances allow"

##  Medium Priority Issues

  - Front matter structure varies across files
  - Inconsistent use of emojis
  - Mixed first-person ("I") vs plural ("we") voice
  - Internal links sometimes have trailing slashes, sometimes don't
  - Duplicate philosophy content (root vs src/content)
  - "Firefly" service mentioned in some places but not others

## The Skylantix Promise

## A hosting company that remembers the internet was meant to be human.

Skylantix isn’t a startup chasing infinite growth. It’s a long-term craft project built on a simple belief: technology should serve people, not the other way around.

When you join Skylantix, you’re not just renting server space — you’re becoming part of a small, self-sustaining community that values privacy, transparency, and care in engineering.

### Our Commitments

1. Fair Pricing, Real Costs    
 What you pay reflects the actual cost of running and improving the service — no hidden fees, no artificial scarcity. Prices adjust only if the real world demands it: hardware, electricity, or bandwidth, not corporate greed.

2. Shared Prosperity    
 If Skylantix has a good year, you’ll feel it too. Some years that means better hardware, more features, or free upgrades. Some years, it means no bill in December. When Skylantix wins, everyone wins.

3. Sustainable Independence    
 We own our hardware, we pay our own bills, and we answer to no investors. That keeps us honest and lets us stay small enough to care.

4. Privacy by Design    
Your data lives here—encrypted at rest and in transit, on physical servers in California. It’s never tracked, mined, or sold.

5. Stewardship Over Growth    
We’re not trying to host the world, just the right kind of people. When we reach our ideal size, we’ll slow down, switch to invites, and focus on making what exists better instead of bigger.

6. Radical Transparency    
We don’t expect trust without proof. Skylantix runs in the open — with status pages, changelogs, and yearly transparency reports that show where money goes, how systems perform, and what we’re improving. Honesty isn’t a feature here; it’s infrastructure.

### A Different Kind of Cloud

Most companies measure success in users and revenue. We measure ours in uptime, trust, and the quiet satisfaction of knowing a few thousand people have a corner of the internet that’s truly theirs.

That’s the deal.

No hype, no fine print — just good infrastructure and good intent.  
The internet works best when it’s personal.  
We’re here to keep it that way.

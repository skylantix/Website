## Your Data. Your Privacy. Your Control.

In an age where big tech treats your personal information as their product, Skylantix offers something different: hosting that respects your privacy and puts you in control of your data.

### Privacy Principles

#### Data Sovereignty
- **California Hosting**: All servers physically located in Orange County, California
- **No Global Replication**: Your data doesn't get automatically copied to regions you didn't authorize
- **Clear Jurisdiction**: U.S. law applies, no ambiguous international data laws
- **You Choose**: You know exactly where your data lives

#### No Surveillance
- **No Data Mining**: We don't analyze the contents of your files or databases
- **No Third-Party Sharing**: We don't sell, share, or monetize your information
- **No AI Training**: Your data isn't used to train language models or other AI systems
- **No Advertising Networks**: We don't integrate tracking pixels or ad platforms

#### Transparent Operations
- **Real Infrastructure**: Physical servers you can understand, not abstract "cloud instances"
- **Clear Ownership**: You know who runs your hosting and how to reach them
- **No Hidden Services**: We tell you exactly what's running and why
- **Open Communication**: Questions about security or privacy? Just ask.

### Security Architecture

**Network Security**:
- All services fronted by Cloudflare for DDoS protection and SSL
- Firewall rules limiting access to only necessary ports
- Regular security updates and patches
- Monitoring for unusual access patterns

**Data Protection**:
- Automated offsite backups following 3-2-1 rule
- Encrypted data transmission (SSL/TLS)
- Access controls limiting who can see your data
- Secure credential management

**Physical Security**:
- Servers in secure location with controlled access
- Redundant power (solar + battery backup + grid)
- Redundant internet (fiber + cable + 5G backup)
- Environmental monitoring

### Who This Is For

**Privacy-Conscious Individuals**:
- People leaving Google Drive for Nextcloud
- Anyone concerned about big tech surveillance
- Those who want control over personal data
- Users tired of being the product

**Small Businesses**:
- Companies that handle customer data responsibly
- Businesses with privacy compliance requirements
- Organizations wanting to avoid hyperscaler vendor lock-in
- Teams needing California-based hosting for regulatory reasons

**Developers & Tech Users**:
- Self-hosters who want reliability without complexity
- People running personal projects with sensitive data
- Developers needing trustworthy infrastructure
- Anyone who values transparency over corporate abstractions

### The Big Tech Alternative

You don't have to choose between convenience and privacy. You don't have to accept surveillance as the cost of cloud services. You don't have to wonder what big tech is doing with your data.

With Skylantix, you get professional managed hosting that respects your privacy, keeps your data in California, and treats you like a personâ€”not a product.

**Simple question**: Do you know where your data is right now? With us, you always will.

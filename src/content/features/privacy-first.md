## Your Data. Your Privacy. Your Dignity.

The internet was meant to be decentralized and personal. But we handed it over to surveillance capitalists who treat your data as their product. Skylantix reclaims that spirit: cooperative infrastructure that respects your privacy and puts you in control.

### Privacy Principles

#### Data Sovereignty
- **California Hosting**: All servers physically located in Orange County (Irvine, Long Beach, Santa Clarita regions)
- **Owner-Managed Hardware**: We own our infrastructure outright—no AWS, no Azure, no hyperscaler lock-in
- **Clear Jurisdiction**: U.S. law applies, no ambiguous international data handling
- **Transparent Location**: You know exactly where your data lives and who manages it

#### No Surveillance
- **No Data Mining**: We don't analyze the contents of your files, emails, or databases
- **No Third-Party Sharing**: We don't sell, share, or monetize your information
- **No AI Training**: Your data isn't used to train language models or other AI systems
- **No Advertising**: We don't integrate tracking pixels, ad networks, or analytics beyond basic server monitoring

#### Community Accountability
- **Published Financials**: Annual reports on revenue, expenses, and profit allocation
- **Member Voting**: Community decides on privacy policies and infrastructure decisions
- **Open Communication**: Questions about security or privacy? Ask on Mattermost. We answer honestly.
- **Transparent Governance**: No corporate opacity—you know how decisions get made

### Security Architecture

**Network Security**:
- All services fronted by Cloudflare for DDoS protection and SSL
- Firewall rules limiting access to only necessary ports
- Regular security updates and patches
- Monitoring for unusual access patterns

**Data Protection**:
- RAID10 storage with Z2/Z3 planned when finances allow
- LUKS encrypted drives for data at rest
- Automated offsite backups following 3-2-1 rule
- End-to-end encryption for Nextcloud
- Encrypted data transmission (SSL/TLS)

**Physical Security**:
- Servers in secure locations with controlled access
- Redundant power (solar + battery backup + grid)
- Redundant internet (fiber + cable + 5G backup)
- Environmental monitoring

### Who This Is For

**Privacy-Conscious Individuals**:
- People leaving Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Photos
- Anyone concerned about big tech surveillance
- Those who want control over personal data
- Users tired of being the product

**Cooperative Members**:
- People who value community over corporations
- Those seeking transparent governance
- Anyone wanting to participate in decision-making
- Members who care about profit sharing and charity

**Digital Sovereignty Advocates**:
- Self-hosters who want reliability without complexity
- People running personal projects with sensitive data
- Anyone who values decentralization
- Users escaping hyperscaler vendor lock-in

### The Skylantix Difference

**Traditional Cloud**: Your data scattered across Amazon's global datacenters. Privacy policies written by lawyers. Terms that change without notice. No idea who has access.

**Skylantix**: Your data on specific hardware in California. Privacy policies written in plain English. Community governance. Your sysadmin knows your name.

### Built for Privacy from Day One

This isn't privacy theater. It's not marketing spin. It's infrastructure designed around the principle that your data belongs to you.

- **Nextcloud** with end-to-end encryption for your files
- **Bitwarden** for password management (no LastPass breaches here)
- **Email** at @mail.skylantix.com without Google scanning it
- **Firefly III** for personal finances without Mint selling your spending habits

### Cooperative Transparency

Because we're a cooperative, privacy isn't just a feature—it's encoded into our governance:

- Members vote on privacy policies
- Annual financial transparency ensures no hidden revenue from data sales
- Community accountability keeps us honest
- Open communication builds trust

### Simple Question

Do you know where your data is right now? With Skylantix, you always will.

Not in "the cloud." In California. On hardware we own. Managed by people you know. Governed by a community you're part of.

That's data sovereignty. That's dignity.

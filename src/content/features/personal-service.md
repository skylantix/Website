## Support That Actually Supports You

Tired of submitting tickets to anonymous support queues? Frustrated by chatbots that don't understand your problem? Skylantix offers something different: personal, human support from someone who knows your infrastructure.

### What Makes Our Support Different

#### You Talk to the Same Team
- Direct communication with the people running your infrastructure
- No rotating cast of support reps
- We remember your previous conversations and your setup
- Continuity and context in every interaction

#### Support Tiers That Scale

**All Tiers:**
- Access to public office hours
- Email ticket support
- Real responses from a real human

**Managed Apps & Up ($40+/month):**
- Google Voice text message support
- Schedule calls 48 hours out
- 24-hour response time

**Complex Hosting ($100+/month):**
- Priority support (4-12 hour response)
- Phone support during business hours
- Same-day call scheduling

**Boutique/Dedicated ($1,000+/month):**
- Direct cell phone access 24/7
- White-glove concierge service
- Proactive monitoring and outreach

### How It Works

**Office Hours**: Regular scheduled times where you can drop in with questions. Think of it like your friend who knows servers being available to help.

**Tickets & Texts**: Reach out when you need help. We respond personally—no canned responses, no script-reading support agents.

**Phone Support**: For higher tiers, call during business hours or even 24/7 for boutique customers. Talk through complex issues in real-time.

**Proactive Support**: On boutique plans, we don't just wait for you to have problems. We monitor proactively and reach out if we see issues developing.

### Why Personal Matters

When your site goes down at 2am, you don't want to explain your entire setup to a tier-1 support agent reading from a script. You want someone who knows your infrastructure and can fix it fast.

When you're planning to scale your app, you want advice from someone who understands your specific setup and business needs—not generic cloud provider documentation.

When you have a weird edge case bug, you want someone who will actually dig into the problem and figure it out—not someone incentivized to close tickets quickly.

That's what personal service means. And that's what you get with Skylantix.

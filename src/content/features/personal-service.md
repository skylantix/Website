## A Digital Village, Not a Service Provider

Tired of being a ticket number? Frustrated by faceless corporations that treat you as a revenue stream? Skylantix is different: a collective microcloud where users know their sysadmin by name.

### What Makes Our Community Different

#### You're a Member, Not a Customer
- Part of a 5,000-member collective (intentionally capped)

- Participate in community discussions on Mattermost
- Shape how the collective evolves

#### Personal Support
- Direct communication via Mattermost or email
- No ticket bureaucracy or rotating support agents
- Talk to the same person who manages your infrastructure
- Continuity and context in every interaction

### How Support Works

**Mattermost Community**: All members get access to our Mattermost instance for support, discussions, and community engagement. Think of it like Slack, but privacy-respecting and community-owned.

**Direct Communication**: Reach out when you need help. We respond personally—no canned responses, no AI chatbots, no script-reading support agents.

**Community Knowledge**: Learn from other members, share solutions, and participate in discussions about privacy, self-hosting, and decentralization.

**Transparent Operations**: Questions about infrastructure, security, or finances? Just ask. We operate in the open because trust requires it.



### Why Community Matters

When you're part of a collective, you're invested in its success. When your sysadmin knows your name, support becomes personal. When you can vote on how surplus profits get allocated, you're not being extracted from—you're participating in governance.

This isn't customer service. It's community.

### Rewarding Early Members

The first 50 members receive exceptional rewards when Skylantix reaches 1,200 members: annual subscribers get free service for life, while monthly subscribers get a permanent 50% discount. This is about building together, not just transacting.

### Comparison to Traditional Hosting

**Traditional Hosting**: You submit tickets. Support agents read from scripts. You're a number in a queue. Your feedback disappears into a void.

**Skylantix**: You chat on Mattermost. Your sysadmin knows your setup. You vote on decisions. Your feedback shapes the collective.

That's what a digital village looks like.

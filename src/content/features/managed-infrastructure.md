## Infrastructure Management Without the Headaches

Running your own infrastructure is powerful. Managing it 24/7 is exhausting. Skylantix gives you the best of both worlds: the control and privacy of self-hosted infrastructure with the convenience of fully managed services.

### What "Actually Managed" Means

This isn't shared hosting where you get a cPanel and basic PHP support. This isn't a VPS where we hand you SSH access and say "good luck." This is comprehensive infrastructure management where we handle everything so you don't have to.

#### Deployment & Configuration
- **Git-Based Workflow**: Push to your repository, we handle deployment
- **CI/CD Integration**: Compatible with GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker and Kubernetes management
- **Environment Configuration**: We set up databases, caching, load balancing
- **SSL Certificates**: Automatic provisioning and renewal via Cloudflare

#### Ongoing Maintenance
- **System Updates**: Regular Debian security patches and system updates
- **Application Updates**: Framework and dependency updates when needed
- **Database Maintenance**: Optimization, vacuuming, index management
- **Log Management**: Rotation, archival, monitoring for issues
- **Resource Optimization**: Performance tuning as your needs evolve

#### Backup & Recovery
- **Automated Backups**: Regular snapshots of all data
- **Offsite Storage**: Backups stored separately for disaster recovery
- **3-2-1 Rule**: Three copies, two media types, one offsite
- **Tested Restores**: We verify backups actually work
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Roll back to earlier versions when needed

#### Monitoring & Response
- **24/7 Automated Monitoring**: Systems watched around the clock
- **Proactive Alerts**: We get notified before you experience downtime
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk, network tracking
- **Application Health Checks**: Verify services are responding correctly
- **Log Analysis**: Automated scanning for errors and anomalies

### Infrastructure Stack

**Operating System**: Debian Linux (stable, secure, well-supported)

**Storage Options**:
- No-RAID configuration (single disk, cost-effective)
- Software RAID1 (mirrored disks for redundancy)

**Network**:
- Cloudflare CDN and DDoS protection
- SSL/TLS encryption for all traffic
- Redundant internet (fiber + cable + 5G backup)

**Power**:
- Solar power with battery backup
- Grid connection for reliability
- Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)

**Orchestration**:
- Docker for containerized applications
- Kubernetes for complex multi-container setups
- Automated scaling and restart policies

### What You Don't Need to Worry About

❌ **No 2am server crashes** - We monitor and respond to issues
❌ **No manual updates** - Patches applied automatically
❌ **No backup configuration** - Set up and running from day one
❌ **No security hardening** - Infrastructure secured by default
❌ **No capacity planning** - We monitor and advise on scaling
❌ **No certificate renewals** - SSL handled automatically
❌ **No log rotation setup** - Maintenance automated
❌ **No database optimization** - We tune for performance

### Who This Is For

**Developers Who Want to Focus on Code**:
- You build apps, we run the infrastructure
- Deploy via Git, we handle the rest
- No ops knowledge required

**Small Business Owners**:
- Run business applications without hiring a sysadmin
- Reliable infrastructure without the complexity
- Focus on your business, not servers

**Self-Hosting Enthusiasts**:
- Want the privacy of self-hosting
- Don't want to manage servers 24/7
- Tried DIY and gave up after the 2am page

**Privacy-Conscious Users**:
- Want to escape Google/Microsoft
- Need reliable alternatives to big tech
- Don't want to become a Linux sysadmin

### The Promise

When you choose managed hosting with Skylantix, here's what you get:

**We handle**: Deployment, monitoring, backups, updates, security, optimization, troubleshooting, capacity planning, disaster recovery

**You handle**: Using your applications, building your business, living your life

That's it. That's managed infrastructure done right.

No waking up to server alerts. No weekends spent debugging networking issues. No late nights applying security patches. Just reliable infrastructure that works, managed by someone who knows what they're doing.

Sleep well. We've got this.

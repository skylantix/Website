## Infrastructure That Works for the Community

Skylantix isn't traditional hosting. It's collective infrastructure—professionally managed, community-governed, and designed for sustainability over growth.

### What "Collective Infrastructure" Means

We own our hardware. We manage it professionally. We operate transparently. And the community benefits from economies of scale that would be impossible for individuals.

#### For All Members ($20/month)
- **Nextcloud & Immich**: 180 GB shared storage with end-to-end encryption
- **Email**: @mail.skylantix.com with 20 GB storage (200 GB total)
- **Bitwarden**: Password manager
- **Linkding**: Bookmark archiving
- **Mattermost**: Community chat and support
- **Gitea**: Git repository hosting

All fully managed. Updates, backups, monitoring, and security handled by the collective.

#### Infrastructure Stack

**Storage & Backups**:
- RAID10 for production data now
- RAID Z2/Z3 backup added at 100 members
- Automated offsite backups following 3-2-1 rule
- LUKS encrypted drives
- Point-in-time recovery available

**Network & Security**:
- Cloudflare CDN for caching (96-98% bandwidth reduction)
- DDoS protection and SSL/TLS
- Firewall rules and regular security updates
- Monitoring for unusual access patterns

**Power & Connectivity**:
- Solar + battery backup + grid power
- Redundant internet: fiber + cable + 5G failover
- Designed for California resilience (rolling blackouts, etc.)

**Computing**:
- Debian Linux (stable, secure, well-supported)
- Docker for containerized applications
- Owner-managed hardware (no hyperscaler lock-in)
- Hardware amortized over 3-5 years for sustainability

### Geographic Distribution

Skylantix starts in Irvine, CA and expands to Long Beach (at 100 members) and Santa Clarita (as demand requires). Each location hosts approximately 1,250 users for optimal load balancing and geographic redundancy.

This approach:
- Balances load across infrastructure
- Provides geographic redundancy
- Maintains data sovereignty in California
- Keeps infrastructure human-scale and manageable

### What You Don't Manage

❌ **No server maintenance** - We handle updates, patches, and security
❌ **No backup configuration** - Automated and tested from day one
❌ **No 2am emergencies** - We monitor and respond to issues
❌ **No capacity planning** - We scale infrastructure as the collective grows
❌ **No certificate renewals** - SSL handled automatically
❌ **No hardware failures** - We manage redundancy and replacements

### What You Do Get

✓ **Reliable Services**: Nextcloud, email, Bitwarden, Linkding, Mattermost, Gitea, Immich, Minecraft Server
✓ **Community Support**: Mattermost chat with your sysadmin and other members
✓ **Transparent Operations**: Know how infrastructure works and where data lives
✓ **Member Governance**: Vote on infrastructure priorities and upgrades
✓ **Sustainable Model**: Hardware amortization ensures stable, predictable costs

### Future: Django & Custom App Hosting

Coming soon for members: managed Django, Python, and containerized app hosting. Because a collective grows with its community's needs.

Community members will vote on:
- When to launch custom app hosting
- Pricing models (included in $20 or add-on?)
- Resource allocation priorities
- Which frameworks to support first

### The Collective Advantage

**Individual Self-Hosting**: You buy hardware, configure everything, manage 24/7, handle failures alone, pay full cost.

**Traditional Hosting**: You rent from corporations, data scattered globally, no governance, surveillance capitalism, opaque pricing.

**Skylantix Collective**: Community owns infrastructure collectively, professional management, transparent governance, California-based, sustainable costs, member benefits.

### Sustainability Model

Infrastructure is designed for long-term sustainability:

- **Fixed Costs**: Hardware amortized over 3-5 years, predictable expenses
- **Community Scale**: 5,000 members share infrastructure costs
- **Efficient Architecture**: Cloudflare caching reduces bandwidth 96-98%
- **Reinvestment**: 50% of surplus profits go to infrastructure upgrades (community votes on priorities)
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: We own hardware outright, no surprise cloud bills

### Who This Is For

**People Escaping Big Tech**:
- Leaving Google Drive, Gmail, Google Photos
- Want privacy without becoming a sysadmin
- Need reliable alternatives to surveillance capitalism

**Collective-Minded Individuals**:
- Value community over corporations
- Want transparent governance
- Care about sustainability and profit sharing

**Privacy Advocates**:
- Need California-based data sovereignty
- Want end-to-end encryption
- Value transparency and accountability

**Practical Self-Hosters**:
- Love the idea of self-hosting
- Don't want to manage servers 24/7
- Tried DIY and realized it's a second job

### The Promise

Skylantix manages infrastructure so you don't have to. We handle deployment, monitoring, backups, updates, security, and optimization. You get reliable services, community support, and transparent governance.

No 2am server alerts. No weekends debugging networking issues. No late nights applying security patches.

Just collective infrastructure that works—for the whole village.

Sleep well. The community's got this.

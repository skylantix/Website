- Work with Docker, Nextcloud, email, monitoring, and security tools
- Fully remote‚ÄîSSH from anywhere
- Flexible hours that work around your schedule
- Get a reference letter and real experience for your resume
- **Be honest:** I'm learning too. We're figuring this out together.

**Paid Opportunities:**
- Mentees who prove themselves can move to paid part-time work ($15-20/hour) as the cooperative grows
- Handle member support and operational tasks
- Fully remote work
- Real job experience while building your skills

**Requirements:**
- Student or recent grad (CS or related field preferred)
- Basic Linux/command line knowledge

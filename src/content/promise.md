            Skylantix isn't a startup chasing infinite growth. It's a long-term craft project built on a simple belief: technology should serve people, not the other way around.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            When you join Skylantix, you're not just renting server space — you're becoming part of a small, self-sustaining community that values privacy, transparency, and care in engineering.

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mb-4">1. Fair Pricing, Real Costs</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    What you pay reflects the actual cost of running and improving the service — no hidden fees, no artificial scarcity. Prices adjust only if the real world demands it: hardware, electricity, or bandwidth, not corporate greed.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    If Skylantix has a good year, you'll feel it too. Some years that means better hardware, more features, or free upgrades. Some years, it means no bill in December. When Skylantix wins, everyone wins.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    We own our hardware, we pay our own bills, and we answer to no investors. That keeps us honest and lets us stay small enough to care.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Your data lives here—encrypted at rest and in transit, on physical servers in California. It's never tracked, mined, or sold.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    We're not trying to host the world, just the right kind of people. When we reach our ideal size, we'll slow down, switch to invites, and focus on making what exists better instead of bigger.

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-red-600 mb-4">6. Radical Transparency</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    We don't expect trust without proof. Skylantix runs in the open — with status pages, changelogs, and yearly transparency reports that show where money goes, how systems perform, and what we're improving. Honesty isn't a feature here; it's infrastructure.

                Most companies measure success in users and revenue. We measure ours in uptime, trust, and the quiet satisfaction of knowing a few thousand people have a corner of the internet that's truly theirs.

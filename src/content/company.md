        <div class="prose prose-lg mx-auto text-gray-600">
            <p>
                Skylantix was founded by a University of Chicago student who loves infrastructure and believes the internet should belong to people, not corporations. I'm learning production sysadmin work by actually doing it—managing real infrastructure for real users.
            </p>
I'm building a <strong>cooperative microcloud</strong>—starting small and growing deliberately toward 5,000 members, with a commitment to transparency and community. You'll talk to me directly via Mattermost, not through ticket systems. Your data stays on California-based hardware I own, not scattered across Amazon's datacenters.</p>
            <p>
                Based in Orange County, California, Skylantix runs on owner-managed servers with redundant internet (fiber + cable + 5G backup), solar power, and battery backup. Everything is fronted through Cloudflare for security and DDoS protection, with automated offsite backups following the 3-2-1 rule.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a human-scale operation by design. Small, sustainable, and built on trust—not market share. $20/month or $200/year. Early members are rewarded for their trust and contributions. <strong>I'm learning alongside the community as we grow together.</strong>

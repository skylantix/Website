            <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-4">
                I got tired of watching people forced to choose between expensive "managed" hosting that still requires technical knowledge, big tech surveillance capitalism, or DIY self-hosting that becomes a second job.

            <p class="text-xl text-gray-600">
                Skylantix is the answer: professional managed hosting with actual personal service, privacy guarantees, and pricing that respects your budget.

        <div class="prose prose-lg mx-auto text-gray-600">
            <p>
                Skylantix was founded by a University of Chicago student who loves infrastructure and DevOps work. After managing dozens of intertwined Docker containers for personal projects with perfect uptime for months, I realized: if I can do this for myself, I can do it for others.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not trying to build the next AWS. I'm building a boutique hosting company that treats customers like people, not ticket numbers. You'll talk to me directly, not a support queue. Your data stays in California, not scattered across faceless datacenters. And you'll pay half what competitors charge because I don't have their overhead.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based in Orange County, California, Skylantix runs on high-performance servers with redundant internet (fiber + cable + 5G backup), solar power, and battery backup. Everything is fronted through Cloudflare for security and DDoS protection, with automated offsite backups following the 3-2-1 rule.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a one-person operation by design. Small, focused, and excellent at what we do: managing your infrastructure so you don't have to.

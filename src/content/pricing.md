    "questions": [
        {
            "question": "What payment methods do you accept?",
            "answer": "We accept all major credit cards and bank transfers. All payments are processed securely. We'll work with you on payment schedules for higher-tier plans."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is there a student discount?",
            "answer": "Yes! UChicago and UC Irvine students (and recent grads) get 3 months free on our Nextcloud or Managed Apps tiers. Just reach out with proof of enrollment or recent graduation."
        },
        {
            "question": "What if I need something custom?",
            "answer": "That's what we do! If you have specific requirements or want to host software not mentioned here, just contact us. We handle any self-hosted software you want to run but don't want to manage."
        },
        {
            "question": "Where is my data hosted?",
            "answer": "All infrastructure is in Orange County, California. Your data stays in California, not scattered across Amazon's datacenters. We use Cloudflare for security and DDoS protection."
        },
        {
            "question": "What kind of support do I get?",
            "answer": "Support is scaled to your tier—from email tickets to direct phone access. You'll talk to a real human (me), not a ticket system. Office hours are available for all tiers, and higher tiers get phone support and faster response times."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?",
            "answer": "Absolutely! Plans are flexible. Contact us and we'll adjust your hosting to match your needs. No long-term contracts or lock-in."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you offer refunds?",
            "answer": "Yes—if you're not satisfied in the first 30 days, we'll refund your money. No questions asked."
        },
        {
            "question": "What about uptime and SLAs?",
            "answer": "We're honest about what we are: a boutique hosting company, not AWS. We aim for high reliability with redundant internet (fiber + cable + 5G backup) and solar + battery power, but we don't claim 99.99% uptime. If you need enterprise-level SLAs, we're probably not the right fit."
        },
        {
            "question": "What infrastructure do you use?",
            "answer": "Everything runs on Debian Linux with LUKS encrypted drives for data security. We offer no-RAID configurations (single disk) and software RAID1 (mirrored) configurations for redundancy. Hourly snapshots provide point-in-time recovery, and all servers are fronted by Cloudflare for security and DDoS protection."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you support CI/CD workflows?",
            "answer": "Yes! We're compatible with GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD pipelines. Send us your Git repo and we'll handle deployment from your existing workflows. Makes updating your apps as simple as pushing to your repository."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you provide application development or debugging?",
            "answer": "No. We manage infrastructure, not application code. We'll deploy your application and keep the servers running, but we don't debug your code, fix application bugs, or provide software development services. If your app has a memory leak, crashes due to code issues, or has performance problems from inefficient queries, that's outside our scope. We'll help identify that it's an application issue and point you in the right direction, but fixing the code is on you."

## Introduction

Welcome to Skylantix, a collective microcloud. These Terms of Service explain the agreement between you (a member) and Skylantix. We've written this in plain language because transparency matters to us.

**The short version:** Be respectful, use services reasonably, pay on time, and we'll provide reliable infrastructure. If something goes wrong, we'll be honest about it.

### Important: Learning Together

Skylantix is run by a University of Chicago student learning production systems administration by managing real infrastructure for real users. This is not enterprise-grade hosting with 99.99% SLAs—it's a craft project and learning experience.

**What this means:**
- I'm learning production infrastructure alongside the community
- While I strive for excellence and reliability, I cannot guarantee specific uptime or availability
- Issues will happen—I'll communicate honestly when they do
- You're joining a collective that values transparency and growth over perfection
- This infrastructure is managed personally, not by a professional operations team

**If you need guaranteed uptime or enterprise SLAs, Skylantix may not be right for you.** But if you value transparency, community, and supporting someone learning while building something meaningful, welcome aboard.

---

## 6. Service Level & Uptime

### Our Goal (Not a Guarantee)

We aim for **99% uptime** (excluding scheduled maintenance) and work diligently to maintain reliable services. However, as stated in the introduction, **we cannot guarantee specific uptime or availability**.

**Our approach:**
- Target less than 7.3 hours of unplanned downtime per month
- Announce scheduled maintenance 48 hours in advance when possible
- Provide transparent incident reporting via status page
- Learn from every issue to improve reliability over time

### What We DON'T Guarantee

We're honest about limitations:
- **No enterprise SLAs** - This is personally managed infrastructure, not a professional operations team
- **Learning process** - I'm improving systems administration skills while running production infrastructure
- **California power outages** - May cause brief interruptions (we have solar + battery backup, but it's not perfect)
- **Internet outages** - Beyond our control (we have redundant connections: fiber, cable, 5G)
- **Force majeure** - Natural disasters, wars, pandemics, etc.
- **Human error** - I'm learning and mistakes will happen; I'll be transparent when they do

### If Service Falls Short

If uptime drops significantly in a month, I'll:
- Communicate transparently about what happened and why
- Offer prorated credits or refunds on a case-by-case basis (at my discretion)
- Publish a detailed incident report explaining what went wrong
- Share what I'm doing to prevent similar issues

**There are no contractual uptime guarantees.** Service credits are goodwill gestures, not contractual obligations.

## 7. Data Ownership & Backups

### Your Data is YOURS

- You own all data you store on Skylantix
- We don't claim any rights to your content
- You can export your data anytime
- We'll help you migrate to another provider if you leave

### Our Backup Responsibility

We maintain automated encrypted backups:
- Daily backups retained for 30 days
- Following 3-2-1 rule (3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite)
- RAID10 for redundancy (RAID Z2/Z3 backup at 100 members)

**IMPORTANT:** Backups are for disaster recovery, not version control. You should maintain your own local backups of critical data.

## 8. Privacy & Security

Your privacy is fundamental. See our [Privacy Policy](/privacy/) for details, but key points:

- We collect minimal data (only what's needed to run services)
- We never sell your data
- Data stays in California on hardware we own
- Encrypted at rest (LUKS) and in transit (SSL/TLS)
- Only infrastructure admin has access (and only for support/maintenance)

**Security Incidents:** If there's a breach affecting your data, we'll notify you within 72 hours with full transparency about what happened.

**Notice & Refunds:**

## 11. Limitation of Liability

### What We're Liable For

If we mess up, we'll make it right:

### What We're NOT Liable For

To the maximum extent permitted by law:
- Lost profits or business opportunities
- Indirect, consequential, or punitive damages
- Data loss if you didn't maintain your own backups
- Third-party services (payment processors, Cloudflare, etc.)

- **Service interruptions or issues arising from the learning nature of this project**

**Important:** By using Skylantix, you acknowledge and accept that this infrastructure is managed by someone learning production systems administration. While every effort is made to maintain reliability, you accept the inherent risks of using personally managed infrastructure that is part of a learning journey.

**Maximum Liability:** Our total liability is limited to the amount you paid in the last 12 months.

3. **Mediation:** If we can't resolve it, we'll try mediation (shared cost)
4. **Arbitration:** Binding arbitration in Orange County, California (if mediation fails)

**No Class Actions:** Disputes must be resolved individually, not as class actions.

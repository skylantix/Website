## Introduction

At Skylantix, privacy isn't just a policyâ€”it's why we exist. We're a privacy-first hosting company. This policy explains exactly what data we collect, why, and what we do (and don't do) with it.

**Short version:** We collect the absolute minimum needed to run your hosting, we don't sell anything to anyone, and your data stays in California.

## What We Collect

### Account & Billing Information
* **Email address** - To communicate with you about your service
* **Name** - For billing and support
* **Billing information** - Processed through secure payment providers (we don't store credit card numbers)

### Technical Information
* **IP addresses** - For security and abuse prevention
* **Server logs** - Standard nginx access logs (automatically rotated and deleted after 30 days)
* **Usage metrics** - Disk space, bandwidth, resource usage (to ensure we're meeting your needs)

### What We DON'T Collect
* No analytics tracking on our website
* No cookies except essential session cookies
* No advertising IDs or tracking pixels
* No data mining or behavioral profiling
* We don't read your hosted data (it's yours, not ours)

---

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information ONLY for:

* **Service Delivery** - Running and maintaining your hosting
* **Billing** - Processing payments and sending invoices
* **Support** - Responding to your questions and issues
* **Security** - Preventing abuse and securing infrastructure
* **Legal Compliance** - Meeting legal obligations (only when required by law)

**We do NOT:**
* Sell your data to anyone, ever
* Use your data for advertising
* Share your information with third parties (except payment processors and only for billing)
* Train AI models on your data
* Mine your data for any purpose

---

## Data Storage & Security

* **Location:** All data is stored in Orange County, California, USA
* **Encryption:** Data at rest is encrypted with LUKS; data in transit uses SSL/TLS
* **Backups:** Automated encrypted backups following 3-2-1 rule
* **Access:** Only the infrastructure administrator (me) has access, and only when necessary for support or maintenance
* **Retention:** Your data is kept as long as you're a customer, then securely deleted within 30 days of cancellation

## Third-Party Services

We work with minimal third parties:

* **Payment Processors** - For billing (they have their own privacy policies)
* **Cloudflare** - For DDoS protection and SSL (they see your IP when you access your hosted services)

That's it. We don't use analytics services, advertising networks, or data brokers.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

* **Access** - Request a copy of all data we have about you
* **Correction** - Fix any inaccurate information
* **Deletion** - Request deletion of your data (we'll delete within 30 days)
* **Export** - Download all your hosted data anytime
* **Portability** - We'll help you migrate to another provider if you want to leave

**To exercise these rights:** Just email hello@skylantix.com

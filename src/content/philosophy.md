        <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The goal is simple: to create a sustainable, human-scale cloud hosting model that values fairness, transparency, and generosity over growth for its own sake.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The internet was meant to be decentralized, personal, and curious. Skylantix simply reclaims that spirit.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-8">
            Skylantix isn't a startup chasing infinite growth. It's a long-term craft project built on a simple belief: technology should serve people, not the other way around.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            When you join Skylantix, you're not just renting server space — you're becoming part of a small, self-sustaining community that values privacy, transparency, and care in engineering.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-8">The Story Behind Skylantix</h2>
        <div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-8">
            <div class="prose prose-lg mx-auto text-gray-600">
                <p>
                    Skylantix was founded by a University of Chicago student who loves infrastructure and believes the internet should belong to people, not corporations. I'm learning production sysadmin work by actually doing it—managing real infrastructure for real users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm building a <strong>collective microcloud</strong>—starting small and growing deliberately toward 5,000 members, with a commitment to transparency and community. After graduation, I'm running this full-time from Orange County, California, where the servers actually live. You'll talk to me directly via Mattermost, not through ticket systems. Your data stays on California-based hardware I own, not scattered across Amazon's datacenters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Skylantix is built on <strong>solid economics from day one</strong>. The infrastructure costs are covered with minimal members, allowing me to focus on growing the collective deliberately rather than desperately. This isn't a venture-backed startup burning cash—it's a sustainable craft project. The infrastructure runs on owner-managed servers with redundant internet and backup power systems. Everything is fronted through Cloudflare for security and DDoS protection, with automated offsite backups following the 3-2-1 rule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a human-scale operation by design. Small, sustainable, and built on trust—not market share. $20/month or $200/year. The first 50 members total get extraordinary perks when we reach 1,250 members: if you chose annual, free service as long as Skylantix operates; if you chose monthly, 50% off as long as Skylantix operates. <strong>We're building this together, deliberately and transparently.</strong>

            A collective microcloud that remembers the internet was meant to be human.

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mb-4">1. Fair Pricing, Real Costs</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    What you pay reflects the actual cost of running and improving the service — no hidden fees, no artificial scarcity. Prices adjust only if the real world demands it: hardware, electricity, or bandwidth, not corporate greed.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-8">

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    If Skylantix has a good year, you'll feel it too. Some years that means better hardware, more features, or free upgrades. Some years, it means no bill in December. When Skylantix wins, everyone wins.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    We own our hardware, we pay our own bills, and we answer to no investors. That keeps us honest and lets us stay small enough to care.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Your data lives here—encrypted at rest and in transit, on physical servers in California. It's never tracked, mined, or sold.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    We're not trying to host the world, just the right kind of people. When we reach our ideal size, we'll slow down, switch to invites, and focus on making what exists better instead of bigger.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    We don't expect trust without proof. Skylantix runs in the open — with status pages, changelogs, and yearly transparency reports that show where money goes, how systems perform, and what we're improving. Honesty isn't a feature here; it's infrastructure.
                </p>

                <p class="text-xl text-center leading-relaxed mb-8">
                    Most companies measure success in users and revenue. We measure ours in uptime, trust, and the quiet satisfaction of knowing a few thousand people have a corner of the internet that's truly theirs.
                </p>
                <p class="text-center text-gray-700 font-semibold text-lg">
                    That's the deal.

                <p class="text-center text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    No hype, no fine print — just good infrastructure and good intent.<br/>
                    The internet works best when it's personal.<br/>

                Skylantix starts in <strong>Orange County, California</strong> with RAID Z3 redundancy. At <strong>100 members</strong>, we add a second geographically distinct node for distribution. As demand grows, additional nodes in geographically separated California locations will be added. Each location will host approximately 1,250 users—balancing load, redundancy, and data sovereignty.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Cloudflare and VPS-based caching, Skylantix can reduce outbound bandwidth by 96–98%, keeping operational costs minimal. Hardware is amortized over 3-5 years, ensuring stable costs while user data remains on owner-managed, privacy-respecting systems. <strong>No hyperscaler lock-in.</strong>
